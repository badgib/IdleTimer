# IdleTimer
Simple little MUSHclient plugin, a floating window with timer counting down to help the user keep track of time to being booted. Made for Discworld MUD but it surely can be repurposed for other MUDS.

## Usage
Put it in your plugins folder and install it as you'd install any other MUSHclient plugin.

## Syntax
!timer toggle

!timer colour <font_colour> <window_background>

!timer size <width> <height>

!timer font <font_size>
